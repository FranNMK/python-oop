# 🏗️ Object-Oriented Programming Assignment

This repository contains solutions for my 
OOP Assignment.  
It demonstrates 
Class Design, Inheritance, Encapsulation, and Polymorphism in Python.  

---

📌 Assignment Overview
Activity 1: Design Your Own Class
- Created a `Smartphone` class with attributes and methods.
- Added a `GamingPhone` class that inherits from `Smartphone`.
- Demonstrates:
  - Constructors (`__init__`)
  - Method overriding
  - Encapsulation (battery and storage management)
  - Inheritance

Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge
- Created a `Vehicle` base class with a `move()` method.
- Subclasses (`Car`, `Plane`, `Boat`) implement `move()` differently:
  - Car → "Driving 🚗"
  - Plane → "Flying ✈️"
  - Boat → "Sailing 🚤"
- Demonstrates **Polymorphism** (same method name, different behavior).
